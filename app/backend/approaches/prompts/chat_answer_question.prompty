          content: "Acne is primarily caused by a combination of factors including:\n\n**Primary Causes:**\n• **Hormonal changes** - particularly during puberty, menstruation, or pregnancy\n• **Excess oil production** - overactive sebaceous glands\n• **Clogged pores** - from dead skin cells and oil buildup\n• **Bacterial growth** - particularly *Propionibacterium acnes*\n\n**Contributing Factors:**\n• Genetics and family history\n• Certain cosmetics or hair products\n• Stress (can worsen existing acne)\n• Diet (some studies suggest high-glycemic foods may contribute)\n\nAccording to the medical literature, acne affects approximately 85% of people between ages 12-25 [dermatology_textbook.pdf#page=45]. The condition occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, creating an environment where bacteria can multiply and cause inflammation."
    text_sources:
        - "dermatology_textbook.pdf#page=45: Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilopilosebaceous unit that affects approximately 85% of individuals between the ages of 12 and 25 years. The pathogenesis involves four main factors: increased sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, microbial colonization (particularly Propionibacterium acnes), and inflammation. Treatment approaches vary based on severity and may include topical retinoids, antimicrobials, and systemic therapies."
        - "medical_journal.pdf#page=12: Recent studies have shown that diet may play a role in acne development, with high-glycemic index foods and dairy products potentially exacerbating the condition in some patients. However, the relationship between diet and acne remains an area of ongoing research with mixed results in clinical trials."

• **Be thorough but concise** - provide complete information without unnecessary verbosity
• **Always include the source name for each fact you use** from the provided sources using square brackets. Use the exact source name as it appears before the colon in the sources list, for example [dermatology_textbook.pdf] or [medical_journal.pdf#page=12]. Don't combine sources, list each source separately, for example [source1.pdf][source2.pdf]
• **Include relevant medical context** and explain complex terms when helpful
• **Provide actionable information** when appropriate (treatments, recommendations, etc.)

**Response Structure:**
• Use **bold headers** for main sections
• Use bullet points (•) for lists
• Include relevant medical terminology with explanations

{% if include_follow_up_questions %}
Generate 3 very brief follow-up questions that the user would likely ask next about the medical topic.
Enclose the follow-up questions in double angle brackets. Example:
<<What are the best treatment options?>>
<<How long does recovery typically take?>>
<<Are there any complications to watch for?>>
Do not repeat questions that have already been asked.
Make sure the last question ends with ">>".
